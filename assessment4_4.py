Assessment 4.4 - Thread Safe Counter

Write a "WordCounter" class that is meant to be able to count words in large texts, so that a user of that class can quickly calculate
how many times a specific word occurs in a string.

"WordCounter" should implement the following methods:

- process_text(text) should take in a string "text", and update the internal attributes of WordCounter in a thread-safe manner.
You may assume naively that text.split(" ") is good enough to return the list of words in the passed "text".

- get_word_count(word) should take in a string "word", and check how many times that word has been seen in all the texts 
that this WordCounter has processed. If this word has never been seen, you should return 0.

NOTE: This class must be thread-safe; meaning that many threads should be able to use the WordCounter at the same time, 
and the calculations must remain accurate as if only a single thread was using the instance of WordCounter.

NOTE: You may NOT use the "Counter" class of the "collections" standard library.
